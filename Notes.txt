Modules
- a module is an encapsulated and reusable chunk of code that has its own context
- in Node.js, each file is treated as a seperate module

Types of Modules
1. Local modules - Modules that we create in out application
2. Build-in modules - Modules that Node.js ships with out of the box
3. Third party modules - Modules written by other developers that we can use in out application
